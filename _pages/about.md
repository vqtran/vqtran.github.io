Hello! I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Google Research NY](https://research.google/people/VinhQTran/) where I work methods for sequence modeling / NLP and machine learning. I am generally interested in anything that can improve, expand, or rethink the functionality of Transformers and other state-of-the-art sequence models. Prior to this, I have worked on a wide variety of projects including generation for news, fact checking, and database visualization. In a previous life I was a full-stack software developer, and prior to that I attended Brown University as an undergrad ('16).
