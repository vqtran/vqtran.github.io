Bio
===

Hello! I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Google Research NY](https://research.google/people/VinhQTran/) where I work on methods for sequence modeling / NLP and machine learning. My research interests are in all things related to improving, expanding, or rethinking the functionality of Transformers and other state-of-the-art sequence models. Prior to this, I worked on a wide variety of projects across Google including natural language generation for news, fact checking, database visualization, and distributed systems. In a previous life I was a full-stack software developer, and prior to that I attended Brown University as an undergrad ('16).
